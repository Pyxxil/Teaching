I completed an Undergraduate Science Degree Majoring in Computer Science at the University of Auckland in September 2018. I am currently in my last semester of an Honours Degree Majoring in Computer Science.

In July of 2016 I was asked to be a Teaching Assistant for Computer Science 210 (Computer Systems 1) for the University of Auckland. I continued to be so until I was promoted to a Graduate Teaching Assistant for this course in March of 2018. I am still a TA for this course.

In July of 2017 I was asked to be a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Computer Science 340 (Operating Systems) for the University of Auckland. I tutored this course for one semester, but have been asked to tutor individual students on the odd ocassion.

In July of 2018 I was asked to help write material for Computer Science 110 (Introduction to Computer Systems) for the University of Auckland. I was then asked to tutor this course for Summer School.

I am currently looking for jobs, hopefully in the education sector. I have recently been asked to apply for a Professional Teaching Fellowship job at the University of Auckland, the closing date for which is the 18th of October this year.

## Inspiration if you need it
I began University life as a Law/Psychology major. I failed 6 of my 8 papers that year, finishing that year with a GPA of 0.25. I did not return to University until July of 2014, where I decided to start a Physics degree. I achieved a GPA of 1.22 (which was including my previous GPA of 0.25, as here in New Zealand an A+ is a 9.0, and my GPA was calculated as (0.25 * 8 + 9) / 9) from that semester prompting my Academic Advisor (someone who was appointed to make sure I could actually pass) to let me back into University.

The following semester I decided to try entering an Engineering Degree with the intent of doing Biomedical Engineering (I had high hopes as a child, okay). I was presented with a list of courses I could take to allow me entrance into Engineering, one of which was Computer Science 101 (our first Computer Science course). I had to achieve a GPA >5.0 (a B) in that semester across 4 courses. I was not able to do so. However, I wasn't dismayed -- I had had my first taste of Computer Science and I had chosen another path. I enrolled in a Computer Science major, taking the second Computer Science (Computer Science 105) course the following semester.

I started Stage Two of my degree in semester one of 2016, taking Computer Science 210 (To those of you keeping track - I did tutor this course the following semester), 230 (Programming Techniques) and 215 (Computer Systems 2). I then proceeded to take Computer Science 111 (An Introduction to Practical Computing), 280 (Introduction to Software Development), and 340 (again, to those of you keeping track I did tutor this in the next semester this was available) in the following semester.

I finished my degree with a 4.6 GPA, maintaining a B+ average in my Computer Science courses.
